		<p class="info"> My name is Daniel Filipkowski. I am a father to a wonderful little girl, husband to an amazing wife, son to an incredible father, and veteran of a beautiful country. I am currently a novice self teaching fron tend developer. I am learning HTML/CSS from the specifications on w3.org. By learning from the w3.org source i am learning the true standards for coding from the men and women who make the standards themselves. I have learned alot over the short time i have been coding. I also continue to learn more every day. The site your are currently on was all designed by myself. I also have had some help along the way from a great developer in the community and someone i look up to alot named Jonathan Sampson. He is also one of the developers who worked on the Brave browser.
		After metting him it gave me the confidence to truly make it in this community and as a result here i am. I hope to bring that came confidence and aspiration to the people around me and learn everything i can about HTML/CSS and the ARIA programs so that i may pass that knowledge down to thoughs around me. Thank you for visiting my page that was jsut a little bit about me. I look forward to hearing from you.
